From meeting 03/10

Doesnt have to be a gap entirely, could be a package is done poorly or takes a different approach

Advised to look at swarm computing and genetic programming. 

Also mentioned that I should schedule for over the Christmas break in my plan

I should have a play around with available packages so I can write about them.

Package rgp does some things but there are a lot more to be done. Perhaps incorporate rgp into my package (how to approach this)
