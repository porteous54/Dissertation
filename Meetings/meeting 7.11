Wrap up background, it only needs to be enough so that I can do the work
 - Sections on Available packages and R package creation counts towards literature
 
 For GP section I only need to cover tree based
  - Mention other types that exist but do not need to go in depth.
  
  Decided for section 4 to be design and go into depth of chosen area
  
  Requirements will be technical this time
   - for example "the package shall allow users to define the function set"
   
   It's better to get something for every section than to do a few sections well
   
   Michael is happy to give me feedback as long as I have a draft to him by week 11.
